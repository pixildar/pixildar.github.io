                <p>Hi, my name is Ildar.</br></br>
                    I am a backend developer from Russia, with a background in computer science, currently based in Milan. My passion for IT has led me to explore a wide range of technologies and tools, including Python, Django, Docker, and many others. I have experience developing enterprise products and am always eager to take on new challenges. Although I have not yet completed my computer science studies, I am constantly learning and striving to improve my skills.
                </br></br>
                I love everything about tech, and I also would be glad to add here some of my electronics projects, or just some courses or tutorials that I take over time.. Gradually they will appear here as soon as I have more free time &#128521;
